# Ordinary Differential Equation Solving Methods  
**<h1>Purpose</h1>**  

Transient response, which consists of natural and step responses, of an RL circuit wtih a DC voltage source V_S , an inductance L, and a resistance R, as shown in Figure 1, can be determined by solving the following ordinary differential equation (ODE) with the initial current i_0 as the initial condition:

V_S=L d/dx i(t)+Ri(t),   i(t_0 )= i_0    (1)

Where i(t) is the current. In Figure 1, the switch is closed at t= t_0
